## Objective
To preprocess the Adult Income dataset by applying feature encoding and scaling techniques.

## Dataset
Adult Income Dataset

## Steps Performed
- Identified categorical and numerical features
- Applied Label Encoding for ordinal features
- Applied One-Hot Encoding for nominal features
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler
- Compared data before and after scaling
- Saved the processed dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
The dataset is now machine-learning ready.

## Processed Dataset
The preprocessed dataset was generated inside the notebook.
Due to GitHub's 25MB file size limit, the processed CSV file is not uploaded.
